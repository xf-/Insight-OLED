 # Insights OLED

> **NOTE** This Theme is based on insights and has NOTHING to do with Decent work on a gray dark theme. I want black for turned of pixels.

 This skin is primarily made for OLED Tablets, because of true back and no LCD Backlight glow.

 ## Suggestions

 Copy the images into default skin folder. Some are not overwritten.

 Set `lock_screen_during_screensaver` to `1` and the tablet will turn of the screen.

 ## Tablets with OLED

 A lot of tablets from Samsungs Tab S Series (not all). I use Samsung Tab S4 because it has perfect ratio with 2560x1600 (nativ decent app size) and USB-C port.

 ## Warning

 Compared to most other themes the settings area modified, because the colors are not variables and was far to bright selecting or editing a profile. This could have side effects after an update of the decent app.
